                                    The most fundamental truth is that we have information on one computer (Computer A) and we want it to be on another computer (Computer B). These computers are not in the same room.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    <b>How do we solve this?</b> The simplest, most primitive way is to physically carry the information (e.g., on a USB stick). This works, but it's slow and doesn't scale. We need a direct, electronic connection.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    So, we run a cable (like an ethernet cable or a fiber optic line) between Computer A and Computer B. We can now send electrical signals or pulses of light down this cable. We can agree on a simple code: a high-voltage signal means "1," and a low-voltage signal means "0."
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We have just created the most basic form of a network: a <b>direct link</b>. We can now send bits (1s and 0s) between two computers.

                                    This works for two computers. But what if we have three computers (A, B, and C) and they all need to talk to each other? We would need a cable from A to B, from B to C, and from A to C. For four computers, we'd need six cables. For 100 computers, we'd need 4,950 cables.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    This is a failure of scale. Connecting every machine to every other machine directly is physically impossible.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    <b>The logical solution</b> is to have a central device. Every computer connects to this one central point (let's call it a <b>Switch</b>). When Computer A wants to talk to Computer C, it sends the message to the switch, and the switch forwards it only to Computer C.

                                    We have just invented a <b>Local Network</b>. A group of computers in close proximity (like an office or a home) can now communicate efficiently.

                                    <br /><br />
                                    Now, if we want to connect to a third network, we just connect our router to their router. Suddenly, we can build a massive, sprawling web by connecting networks to other networks.

                                    We have built a global web of interconnected networks. If I'm on my computer in my office, how do I send a message to a specific server in another country? There are millions of computers. I need a unique address for every single device.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    This gives rise to the need for a universal addressing system. Just like the postal service needs a unique street address for every house in the world, our network of networks needs a unique address for every connected device.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    This is the reason the <b>IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)</b> exists. It's a unique label (e.g., 142.250.184.142) assigned to each device. When a router sees a message, it looks at the destination IP address and says, "Based on this address, I don't need to send it to the network on my left; I need to send it to the network on my right to get it one step closer to its final destination." Routers don't know the full path; they just know the next best "hop" to send the message on.
